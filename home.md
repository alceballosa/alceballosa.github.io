<p style='text-align: justify;'>
I am a Colombian computer scientist from the small coast town of Ci√©naga, Magdalena. I am currently a researcher in digital image processing and applied bioinformatics at Universidad Nacional de Colombia. My main areas of interest lie in the application of image processing algorithms to biological images. As for software development, I love to implement data engineering and data visualization workflows that enable other professionals to obtain insights from data. Starting on Fall 2021, I will be a Ph.D. student at Northeastern University, in Boston.

<br/><br/>
Since 2019, I collaborate with Professor David C. Schwartz's Laboratory for Molecular and Computational Genomics @ University of Wisconsin - Madison. As part of my work there, I have developed algorithms for processing images and signals toward the development of a novel genome mapping system.
