        I am a Colombian computer scientist from the small coast town of
        Ci√©naga, Magdalena. I am currently a researcher in digital image
        processing and applied bioinformatics at Universidad Nacional de
        Colombia. My main areas of interest lie in computer vision and in the application of image
        processing algorithms to biological images. As for software development,
        I love to implement data engineering and data visualization workflows
        that enable other professionals to obtain insights from data. Starting
        on Fall 2021, I will be a Computer Science Ph.D. student at Northeastern University, in
        Boston.

        Since 2019, I collaborate with Professor <a href="https://genetics.wisc.edu/staff/schwartz-david/">David C. Schwartz</a>'s Laboratory
        for Molecular and Computational Genomics @ University of Wisconsin -
        Madison. As part of my work there, I have developed algorithms for
        processing images and signals toward the development of a novel genome
        mapping system.
